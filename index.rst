    but I logged in at quicken.com/sign-in, found my subscription under 'My Account,' and downloaded it without any issues. 
    The installation took less than 10 minutes, and after logging in, all my data synced automatically. 
    I even restored my last backup and was back to budgeting like nothing had changed. Super smooth and user-friendly!”
